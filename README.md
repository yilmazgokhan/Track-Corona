# Track Corona App

## Introduction
I will introduce you to how to use Huawei Native Ads in RecyclerView, marker display operations on Huawei MapView.

About the app: The app has a single screen, this screen has a fullscreen Map and Bottom Sheet Dialog. Users can select “World Wide” for see all countries’ Corona information or users can select specific country from list for same purpose. The information shows in custom InfoWindow.

## Project Structure

Track Corona App is designed with MVP design pattern.

Official permission is required to publish apps containing Coronavirus data on Huawei App Gallery. Track Corona is my personal app and I don’t have any permission so the app is not available on the Huawei AppGallery.
